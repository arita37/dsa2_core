    "#How Good Is This Wine?  - Using A.I For Quality Control\n",
    "Hello everyone, and a warm welcome to this interactive tutorial where we´ll be exploring how we can use some pretty simple A.I to automate our Quality Control process, saving us time and money.\n",
    "\n",
    "As always, our mission here is to show people in all types of business, that these A.I  tools are available to them and that they can use them without any technical knowledge. You don´t need to know the code behind Microsoft Word in order to use it, right? I hope to convince you that the same applies here.\n",
    "\n",
    "##Introducing the data\n",
    "\n",
    "So, for today, say  hello to our dataset: a list of 5,000 white wines with information about their chemical properties, things like sulphates, chlorides, PH levels, etc. (you can have a look at the complete spreadsheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YU2sqcuG4_DAzYvD-uLbp5NHg21S51CxILCq9xPaOsE/edit#gid=1916199166))\n",
    "\n",
    "Right, so why on earth would that be of any use to us?\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine the following scenario: Let´s say we are medium-sized wine distributor, we receive wines from producers, store them and then supply them to liquor stores around the country or even sell them online.  Let´s say that we carry out on a daily basis random quality control tests on samples of wines we receive from the producers. The spreadsheet we are going to be working with today is comprised from all these past tests that we have carried out. Let´s have a look."

However, we can use an algorithm to delve into the data for us and find commonalities between different wines in order to form categories  (this is also known as clustering). This is incredibly useful since it means we can transform a big bulk of unsorted data into a neat set of categories. We can then use those categorizes for lots of things, such as market research (finding different groups of customers of our business), for technical support (what are the different sort of queries received), or for re-organizing our produt range (like in our case with wine). I could go on and on with the use cases.\n",

Each point is a different sample however when two points are the same color, we can think of them as being similar and thus belonging to the same category. This is how we can categorize our data!\n",
    "\n",
    "The great thing here is that we can choose how many categories  we want. We could ask our algorithm to separate our data into 20 categories  or just 2. This decision will be based on our business context.

    "So now here is the fun part. Now that we have this list of wines that supposedly share something common, we let’s physically go to our warehouse and pull out the wines listed it out for each category and see what they all have in common. It could be all sorts of things, maybe the wines from each category are from a different type of grape (*Sauvignon*, *Pinot*, etc.), or maybe they come from a different region (*South America*, *North America*, *Europe*) or maybe they are from large producers or small producers. Whatever it is, there should be some sort of commonality that jumps out at you straight away and that explains why the algorithm separated the data in this way.\n",

    "Now let´s imagine that in our case, after a rather fun tasting session that dragged on late into the night (and the effect of which may explain why you previously tested red white by mistake), it becomes clear to us that the algorithm separated our data in terms of quality. Rather impressive, and this is fantastic, because quality is related to price. This means that our algorithm is capable, in our fictional example, of discriminating by taste quality and we can use this to set our pricing for our wine. So we can now automate our pricing process!\n",

The reason for this is despite this being a 2D plot, you should actually think of it as 3D. Imagine that it is in fact a hill and that we are looking down at it from above. When our data is multi-dimensional it is always hard to visualize. For example our spreadsheet has 11 columns, which means it needs to be represented in ***11-D***. This is impossible for our feeble human brain but thankfully, it is something that computers find very easy to do. As such, the sorts of visualizations like the one above is probably as close as we´ll ever be able to get to visualizing complex datasets like the one we have today.\n",

    "I hope you were able to follow this tutorial. The point that I wish to make here is that even when we have a dataset that is just a jumbled mess of observations, we can still find plenty of ways to extract value from it and use it accelerate our work. I used quality control and categorization here because these take up a lot of time, and yet they are relatively easy to automate. Go have a look out what old spreadsheets you have may have on your hard drive and have a think at how you could implement the methodology and techniques we discussed above for yourself.\n",
